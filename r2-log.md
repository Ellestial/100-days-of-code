# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 1: June 17, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Read You Don't Know JS: this & Object Prototypes - Chapter 1.

**Thoughts**: I am immediately starting round 2 of the 100 Days of Coding challenge. Today I learned that this does not refer to the function it is used in itself or the lexical scope of said function. I also learned a bit more about how functions are objects.


## Day 2: June 18, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Began reading You Don't Know JS: this & Object Prototypes - Chapter 2.

**Thoughts**: This is taking a while to follow, though now I am understanding that the `this` keyword is based on object context, with 4 rules dictating the definition: a general default fallback binding if no other rules apply (which is Window), implicit binding, explicit binding, and another kind I haven't learned about yet. I'm excited to have finally learned what call(), apply(), and bind() do.
