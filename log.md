# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, 2018

**Readings**: Started reading Eloquent JavaScript. I read through the Introduction and about 1/5 of the way through Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators.

**Today's Progress**: Dove back into JS. Refamiliarized myself with strings, arrays, and functions on FreeCodeCamp. Got about halfway through the Basic JavaScript section.

**Thoughts**: It's good to get back to JavaScript! I'm remembering more than I expected and didn't have any issues on FreeCodeCamp, which is probably why I was able to get through what they consider 5 hours of content in 45 minutes or so. I'm learning more from this Eloquent JavaScript eBook, too, which is nice. I learned that bits are two-valued things, and that 32-bit and 64-bit computers are related to how many bits can run simultaneously. It's interesting getting this different sort of background.

### Day 2: January 9, 2018

**Readings**: None for the day.

**Today's Progress**: Got through about a quarter of the way through the Basic JavaScript section on FreeCodeCamp. Mostly discussed booleans, if statements, and switches. I then took a break from the lessons to jump to the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges. I did these last year, but forgot them and was still able to get through the first two quickly.

**Thoughts**: It still felt very much like a review today, so I'm pretty excited these concepts have stuck in my mind even though I haven't touched FreeCodeCamp and JavaScript in almost a year. It felt especially good to get through a couple algorithm challenges without frustration. Someone in my FreeCodeCamp group on Facebook mentioned there was a really good deal for a large web development course on Udemy. I purchased it -- looks like it has an active community, 40+ hours of video, and gives you projects to make. I'm excited and got through a bit of the intro to the course.
