# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, 2018
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Readings**: Started reading Eloquent JavaScript. I read through the Introduction and about a quarter of the way through Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators.

**Today's Progress**: Dove back into JS. Refamiliarized myself with strings, arrays, and functions on FreeCodeCamp. Got about halfway through the Basic JavaScript section.

**Thoughts:** It's good to get back to JavScript! I'm remembering more than I expected and didn't have any issues on FreeCodeCamp, which is probably why I was able to get through what they consider 5 hours of content in 45 minutes or so. I'm learning more from this Eloquent JavaScript eBook, too, which is nice. I learned that bits are two-valued things, and that 32-bit and 64-bit computers are related to how many bits can run simultaneously. It's interesting getting this different sort of background.
