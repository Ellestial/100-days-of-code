# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, 2018

**Readings**: Started reading Eloquent JavaScript. I read through the Introduction and about 1/5 of the way through Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators.

**Today's Progress**: Dove back into JS. Refamiliarized myself with strings, arrays, and functions on FreeCodeCamp. Got about halfway through the Basic JavaScript section.

**Thoughts**: It's good to get back to JavaScript! I'm remembering more than I expected and didn't have any issues on FreeCodeCamp, which is probably why I was able to get through what they consider 5 hours of content in 45 minutes or so. I'm learning more from this Eloquent JavaScript eBook, too, which is nice. I learned that bits are two-valued things, and that 32-bit and 64-bit computers are related to how many bits can run simultaneously. It's interesting getting this different sort of background.

### Day 2: January 9, 2018

**Readings**: None for the day.

**Today's Progress**: Got through about a quarter of the way through the Basic JavaScript section on FreeCodeCamp. Mostly discussed booleans, if statements, and switches. I then took a break from the lessons to jump to the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges. I did these last year, but forgot them and was still able to get through the first two quickly.

**Thoughts**: It still felt very much like a review today, so I'm pretty excited these concepts have stuck in my mind even though I haven't touched FreeCodeCamp and JavaScript in almost a year. It felt especially good to get through a couple algorithm challenges without frustration. Someone in my FreeCodeCamp group on Facebook mentioned there was a really good deal for a large web development course on Udemy. I purchased it -- looks like it has an active community, 40+ hours of video, and gives you projects to make. I'm excited and got through a bit of the intro to the course.

### Day 3: January 10, 2018

**Readings**: None for the day.

**Today's Progress**: I completed Section 8: Introduction To JavaScript in the Web Developer Bootcamp course. I also tackled two more of the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I feel a bit odd about reviewing items that I'm already pretty comfortable with (variables, primitive data types, etc.), but I also wanted to make sure to really tackle all of this course I purchased (other than HTML/CSS). I'm glad I did! I didn't realize you could enter sample code into the console and have it remember variables, run functions, etc. I also forgot the difference between undefined and null, and didn't know undefined == null results in true.

### Day 4: January 11, 2018

**Readings**: None for the day.

**Today's Progress**: I got through if statements and boolean information in the Web Developer Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts**:  It took longer than I expected, especially since I'm familiar with this material. I may be too tired. I should work on starting JavaScript before 9:00PM.

### Day 5: January 12, 2018

**Readings**: Finished Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators in Eloquent JavaScript.

**Today's Progress**: Finished one Basic Algorithm Scripting challenge in FreeCodeCamp and got through while loops in the Web Developer Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts**:  Today went better -- yesterday I had issues with this one specific FreeCodeCamp challenge that I figured out today. It involved arrays and array.prototype.map(), so I learned about that. I also got a nice while loop review, and learned about how the developer console will show all results from a while loop, including the evaluation that stops the loop (because the increment/decrement occurs at the end of the true evaluated result).

### Day 6: January 13, 2018

**Readings**: Finished Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators in Eloquent JavaScript.

**Today's Progress**: Got through for loops in the Web Developer Bootcamp course. This means I finished Section 9: JavaScript Control Flow.

**Thoughts**:  I'm very happy with this bootcamp course so far. It feels much more connected and beneficial than other JavaScript tutorials I've taken. I enjoy doing this in conjunction with FreeCodeCamp, though, since the latter has a nice range of challenges to tackle once I learn the skills necessary for them.

### Day 7: January 14, 2018

**Readings**: Began reading Chapter 2: Program Structure in Eloquent JavaScript. About 1/5 through.

**Today's Progress**: Covered functions, arguments, the return keyword, and example problems in the Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**:  I spent some time just searching for various JS/programming terms I had questions about, which was somewhat overwhelming, but also interesting. I'm feeling more confident and excited about this Udemy course. I'm learning tidbits that are helpful for my overall understanding of the language that I haven't learned about from my other resources. Example: every function returns something, even if it's just undefined, which explains why I see undefined when I call console.log(). Interesting!

### Day 8: January 15, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Covered scope and higher order function definitions. Then I jumped into arrays and array methods including: pop(), shift(), push(), unshift(), indexOf(), and slice() in the Web Developer Bootcamp. I also made a rudimentary To Do list.

**Thoughts**:  I felt that there was a lot of review today, but I was excited to make a To Do list on my own. There was a "code along" section in the course for this, but I created it on my own before watching it and did a correct job. Plus, I added one small feature (deleting the last To Do item). So that was exciting to see some real code working!

### Day 9: January 16, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Focused on forEach() and for array iterations, as well as splice() in the Web Developer Bootcamp. I also made a refined my To Do list and focused on reorganizing my code by breaking out functions to help logic-heavy loops feel more readible.

**Thoughts**:  It was exciting to learn about forEach() and experiment with that. I also enjoyed adjusting the To Do list to be able to delete any item.

### Day 10: January 17, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Covered some array sample problems, and learned how to create my own forEach() method in the Web Developer Bootcamp. I also tackled 3 of the algorithm scripting challenges on FreeCodeCamp (return longest number in an array, repeat a string, and truncate a string).

**Thoughts**:  I started off today by trying to solve a problem that my coworker gave me. I spent about an hour on this and could not figure it out, to my dismay. That was frustrating, but I'm glad I moved onto finishing up the arrays section in the bootcamp. I was able to easily solve the array sample problems. One thing I learned, though, was that if you use forEach() in another function and want to return a value, that will only return the value for the forEach() function, it will not close out of the parent function. Good to know!

### Day 11: January 18, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished the JavaScript Basics: Objects section in the Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: I thought it was really interesting to learn that arrays are actually objects -- their key/value pairing is just index/value for them. I also learned more differences between arrays and objects that I think are helpful, such as how arrays are specifically about order/list, while objects are arbitrary and do not have any concept of order. Briefly touched on the keyword 'this,' which I have heard is very confusing from various programmers.

### Day 12: January 19, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Got through about half of the section on DOM Manipulation in the Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: I'm excited to finally mess with HTML/CSS with my JS because of the DOM. Today was covering the very basics, including: getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), getElementsByTagName(), querySelector(), and querySelectorAll() and focusing on just being able to target elements that way. I also learned that every HTML/CSS element is actually an object.

### Day 13: January 20, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the section on DOM Manipulation in the Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: I learned about .classList.add("class-name"), .classList.remove("another-class"), and .classList.toggle("another-class") and the benefits of each. I also learned .textContent and .innerHTML and learned how you can add HTML tags to the .innerHTML list node. Finally, I learned that .getAttribute() and .setAttribute() methods can be very beneficial, as well as looping through to adjust content based on the [i] index of the element.

### Day 14: January 21, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Started Advanced DOM Manipulation, where I learned to toggle a background color change when clicking a button. Also started on a larger project with the Web Developer Bootcamp course called Score Keeper. You add a point to player 1 or 2 and monitor who is winning and when the game has ended. This will push into tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad to finally get into DOM manipulation in more detail. I didn't get as far as I wanted today, because I wanted to try making the Score Keeper project without going through the Web Developer Bootcamp lecture on it. Will push forward tomorrow with hopefully more success.
