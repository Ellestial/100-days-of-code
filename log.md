# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 8, 2018

**Readings**: Started reading Eloquent JavaScript. I read through the Introduction and about 1/5 of the way through Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators.

**Today's Progress**: Dove back into JS. Refamiliarized myself with strings, arrays, and functions on FreeCodeCamp. Got about halfway through the Basic JavaScript section.

**Thoughts**: It's good to get back to JavaScript! I'm remembering more than I expected and didn't have any issues on FreeCodeCamp, which is probably why I was able to get through what they consider 5 hours of content in 45 minutes or so. I'm learning more from this Eloquent JavaScript eBook, too, which is nice. I learned that bits are two-valued things, and that 32-bit and 64-bit computers are related to how many bits can run simultaneously. It's interesting getting this different sort of background.

### Day 2: January 9, 2018

**Readings**: None for the day.

**Today's Progress**: Got through about a quarter of the way through the Basic JavaScript section on FreeCodeCamp. Mostly discussed booleans, if statements, and switches. I then took a break from the lessons to jump to the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges. I did these last year, but forgot them and was still able to get through the first two quickly.

**Thoughts**: It still felt very much like a review today, so I'm pretty excited these concepts have stuck in my mind even though I haven't touched FreeCodeCamp and JavaScript in almost a year. It felt especially good to get through a couple algorithm challenges without frustration. Someone in my FreeCodeCamp group on Facebook mentioned there was a really good deal for a large web development course on Udemy. I purchased it -- looks like it has an active community, 40+ hours of video, and gives you projects to make. I'm excited and got through a bit of the intro to the course.

### Day 3: January 10, 2018

**Readings**: None for the day.

**Today's Progress**: I completed Section 8: Introduction To JavaScript in the Web Developer Bootcamp course. I also tackled two more of the Basic Algorithm Scripting challenges in FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I feel a bit odd about reviewing items that I'm already pretty comfortable with (variables, primitive data types, etc.), but I also wanted to make sure to really tackle all of this course I purchased (other than HTML/CSS). I'm glad I did! I didn't realize you could enter sample code into the console and have it remember variables, run functions, etc. I also forgot the difference between undefined and null, and didn't know undefined == null results in true.

### Day 4: January 11, 2018

**Readings**: None for the day.

**Today's Progress**: I got through if statements and boolean information in the Web Developer Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts**:  It took longer than I expected, especially since I'm familiar with this material. I may be too tired. I should work on starting JavaScript before 9:00PM.

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 5: January 12, 2018

**Readings**: Finished Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators in Eloquent JavaScript.

**Today's Progress**: Finished one Basic Algorithm Scripting challenge in FreeCodeCamp and got through while loops in the Web Developer Bootcamp course.

**Thoughts**:  Today went better -- yesterday I had issues with this one specific FreeCodeCamp challenge that I figured out today. It involved arrays and array.prototype.map(), so I learned about that. I also got a nice while loop review, and learned about how the developer console will show all results from a while loop, including the evaluation that stops the loop (because the increment/decrement occurs at the end of the true evaluated result).

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 6: January 13, 2018

**Readings**: Finished Chapter 1: Values, Types, and Operators in Eloquent JavaScript.

**Today's Progress**: Got through for loops in the Web Developer Bootcamp course. This means I finished Section 9: JavaScript Control Flow.

**Thoughts**:  I'm very happy with this bootcamp course so far. It feels much more connected and beneficial than other JavaScript tutorials I've taken. I enjoy doing this in conjunction with FreeCodeCamp, though, since the latter has a nice range of challenges to tackle once I learn the skills necessary for them.

**Link to work:** N/A


### Day 7: January 14, 2018

**Readings**: Began reading Chapter 2: Program Structure in Eloquent JavaScript. About 1/5 through.

**Today's Progress**: Covered functions, arguments, the return keyword, and example problems in the Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**:  I spent some time just searching for various JS/programming terms I had questions about, which was somewhat overwhelming, but also interesting. I'm feeling more confident and excited about this Udemy course. I'm learning tidbits that are helpful for my overall understanding of the language that I haven't learned about from my other resources. Example: every function returns something, even if it's just undefined, which explains why I see undefined when I call console.log(). Interesting!

### Day 8: January 15, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Covered scope and higher order function definitions. Then I jumped into arrays and array methods including: pop(), shift(), push(), unshift(), indexOf(), and slice() in the Web Developer Bootcamp. I also made a rudimentary To Do list.

**Thoughts**:  I felt that there was a lot of review today, but I was excited to make a To Do list on my own. There was a "code along" section in the course for this, but I created it on my own before watching it and did a correct job. Plus, I added one small feature (deleting the last To Do item). So that was exciting to see some real code working!

### Day 9: January 16, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Focused on forEach() and for array iterations, as well as splice() in the Web Developer Bootcamp. I also made a refined my To Do list and focused on reorganizing my code by breaking out functions to help logic-heavy loops feel more readible.

**Thoughts**:  It was exciting to learn about forEach() and experiment with that. I also enjoyed adjusting the To Do list to be able to delete any item.

**Link to work:** [To Do List 2 Example](https://github.com/Ellestial/100-days-of-code/blob/master/code-examples/009scriptTodo.js)


### Day 10: January 17, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Covered some array sample problems, and learned how to create my own forEach() method in the Web Developer Bootcamp. I also tackled 3 of the algorithm scripting challenges on FreeCodeCamp (return longest number in an array, repeat a string, and truncate a string).

**Thoughts**:  I started off today by trying to solve a problem that my coworker gave me. I spent about an hour on this and could not figure it out, to my dismay. That was frustrating, but I'm glad I moved onto finishing up the arrays section in the bootcamp. I was able to easily solve the array sample problems. One thing I learned, though, was that if you use forEach() in another function and want to return a value, that will only return the value for the forEach() function, it will not close out of the parent function. Good to know!

### Day 11: January 18, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Started and finished the JavaScript Basics: Objects section in the Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: I thought it was really interesting to learn that arrays are actually objects -- their key/value pairing is just index/value for them. I also learned more differences between arrays and objects that I think are helpful, such as how arrays are specifically about order/list, while objects are arbitrary and do not have any concept of order. Briefly touched on the keyword 'this,' which I have heard is very confusing from various programmers.

### Day 12: January 19, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Got through about half of the section on DOM Manipulation in the Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: I'm excited to finally mess with HTML/CSS with my JS because of the DOM. Today was covering the very basics, including: getElementById(), getElementsByClassName(), getElementsByTagName(), querySelector(), and querySelectorAll() and focusing on just being able to target elements that way. I also learned that every HTML/CSS element is actually an object.

### Day 13: January 20, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Finished the section on DOM Manipulation in the Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: I learned about .classList.add("class-name"), .classList.remove("another-class"), and .classList.toggle("another-class") and the benefits of each. I also learned .textContent and .innerHTML and learned how you can add HTML tags to the .innerHTML list node. Finally, I learned that .getAttribute() and .setAttribute() methods can be very beneficial, as well as looping through to adjust content based on the [i] index of the element.

### Day 14: January 21, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Started Advanced DOM Manipulation, where I learned to toggle a background color change when clicking a button. Also started on a larger project with the Web Developer Bootcamp course called Score Keeper. You add a point to player 1 or 2 and monitor who is winning and when the game has ended. This will push into tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I'm glad to finally get into DOM manipulation in more detail. I didn't get as far as I wanted today, because I wanted to try making the Score Keeper project without going through the Web Developer Bootcamp lecture on it. Will push forward tomorrow with hopefully more success.

### Day 15: January 22, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: I finished up the Score Keeper code-along and I also messed around a bit with mouseover and mouseout events. This finished the Advanced DOM Manipulation section in the Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: I felt a lot better about today than yesterday. I feel I learned a lot from these code alongs, even though I wanted to do it myself. It was helpful for me to admit I wasn't quite sure what to do and actually follow along with the video to learn more about solving different kinds of problems.

### Day 16: January 23, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: I'm working ahead on the Color Game project in the Web Developer Bootcamp. I watched the first video that just explained the goals, and am attempting to do all of the work myself before watching any further demonstrations.

**Thoughts**: This is rough! But also rewarding. I worked on this project for about 3 hours without realizing it, and have made some strides. I struggle in some areas, but I'm also able to do some things I wasn't expecting. Hoping to get more progress tomorrow! I had planned to finish this project tomorrow, but may need to work longer in order to really do it myself, but that's ok.

**Links to work:** None. Yet!


### Day 17: January 24, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Continued work on the Color Game.

**Thoughts**: I'm slowly going insane, I think. I worked on this for like 3.5 hours today. Still haven't watched any of the code-along videos. I'm really getting close. Should be done tomorrow!

**Links to work:** None. Yet!


### Day 18: January 25, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: I FINISHED THE COLOR GAME.

**Thoughts**: Wow, this feels incredible. My first JavaScript/HTML/CSS ...thing... that I made entirely on my own. I know the JS could be cleaned up a lot, and I want to revisit it in a few weeks after I learn more, but this is such a big accomplishment for me. It took about 8 or 9 hours over the course of the last 3 days, but I did it.

### Day 19: January 26, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Went through the Intro to jQuery section in the Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: It's been a few days since I watched a tutorial, so it was a nice change to learn things from an instructor. jQuery makes a lot of sense, and I'm also getting some "ah hah!" moments on how I interpret the code the programmers do at my job.

**Links to work:** [jQuery Examples](https://github.com/Ellestial/100-days-of-code/tree/master/code-examples/019jqueryExample)


### Day 20: January 27, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Went through the Advanced jQuery section in the Web Developer Bootcamp. Also set up some files for the To Do List project I will be making tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: jQuery seems pretty great! I worry about relying on it, though, so I'm curious to see what other developers think of it.

**Links to work**: [Advanced jQuery Examples](https://github.com/Ellestial/100-days-of-code/tree/master/code-examples/020jqueryAdvanced)


### Day 21: January 28, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Created a To Do List app using jQuery.

**Thoughts**: Well...I got through about 90% of this app. I was surprised with how little code is required with using jQuery, which is nice. However, I'm having a few difficulties that I'll need to explore more tomorrow. I also am worried because I feel like I already forgot a lot from the color game project I worked on a few days ago. Maybe it's just an off day, though.

### Day 22: January 29, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Watched the instructional videos for the To Do List I created yesterday.

**Thoughts**: I was excited to see that I did most of everything correctly. The one exception was that I didn't know about the stopPropagation() jQuery method. I also chose to duplicate one <li> item from the HTML at a time instead of creating my own <li> in the JS, so that I could update the HTML and have all of the items update easily too. So maybe that's a preferential choice? Either way, I feel good that I knew what I was doing after all.

### Day 23: January 30, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Watched a few instructional videos on creating a patatap clone from the Web Developer Bootcamp. Decided to stop and attempt the project on my own.

**Thoughts**: Today was very frustrating and I didn't get nearly as far as I had hoped. I'm having a hard time trying to understand the syntax and just how to work with the paper.js library.

**Links to work:** None.


### Day 24: January 31, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Got through the patatap clone section in the Web Developer Bootcamp.

**Thoughts**: This was very frustrating and hard. I feel like I should have experimented more on my own before diving into libraries and learning this sort of thing. This section in the bootcamp was an optional one, but I dove right in immediately regardless. I was not able to work ahead to figure out the code on my own, and instead needed to follow along in the videos even after spending over an hour reading through the paper.js tutorials.

### Day 25: February 1, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: Finished three FreeCodeCamp algorithm challenges.

**Thoughts**: This was easier than when I worked on these before! Still a challenge, but I was able to get through these a lot quicker than when I tried prior to the Web Developer Bootcamp. I'm definitely feeling the benefit of coding every day.

## Day 26: February 2, 2018

**Readings**: None.

**Today's Progress**: ...Limited. I worked on the Seek and Destroy FreeCodeCamp challenge for 2.5 hours. I researched the Array.prototype.filter() method and the arguments object.

**Thoughts**: This was very frustrating and frankly made me feel dumb. The challenge states, "You will be provided with an initial array (the first argument in the destroyer function), followed by one or more arguments. Remove all elements from the initial array that are of the same value as these arguments." I am struggling with being able to make a loop within a filter() method. I need to call it for the night, though, because all I've done tonight was make dinner and work on this and it's a Friday night and I want to not tear my hair out tonight.

**Links to work:** None today.


## Day 27: February 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Got through one FreeCodeCamp algorithm challenge.

**Thoughts**: I put the challenge that frustrated me yesterday on hold. I figure I will come back to it when I'm better equipped for that sort of challenge. Instead, I moved onto one that incorporated using the Array.prototype.sort() function, which I hadn't been exposed to before. I learned how to use that, so I feel better about my progress today.

**Links to work:** [Day 27 Algorithm Challenge](https://github.com/Ellestial/100-days-of-code/blob/master/code-examples/027freeCodeCampBelong.js)


## Day 28: February 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Array.from(), Array.of(), Array.isArray(), Array.prototype.fill(), and Array.prototype.copyWithin().

**Thoughts**: I have been worried that I'm getting ahead of myself in the various algorithm challenges, so I'm spending time reading through and understanding each of the inherit instances of array/string/function/object. I decided to start with arrays. So I'm going through MDN for each of them and actually logging notes to myself.

**Links to work:** [Private Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1hikeDDVhWlM416k0qwvencVcu8LD2IrZbKLOmNtl3Pw/edit?usp=sharing)


## Day 29: February 5, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Array.prototype mutator methods: pop(), push(), reverse(), sort(), splice(), shift(), and unshift(). Took notes on them, as well as some accessor methods: includes(), indexOf(), lastIndexOf(), concat(), and join().

**Thoughts**: This is a bit slow-moving, but I think it's good to review the full definition of each of these methods. I think I should finish the array methods tomorrow, and then I may try to find some array challenges to test out my new knowledge. It was a tad hard to focus today, maybe because I hadn't gotten much sleep. I need to make sure to get to bed earlier.

**Links to work:** None.


## Day 30: February 6, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed Array.prototype mutator methods slice() and toString(). Also started reading through iteration array methods entries() (which I do not understand) and every(). Finished up one FreeCodeCamp challenge.

**Thoughts**: I started going through the FreeCodeCamp challenge and felt much more confident because of my reviewing the array methods I have so far. This encourages me to finish up reading through the rest of the list, even though it ends up just being a lot of memorization and reading right now. I know it will pay off, as it already has with this one challenge I could not do before.

**Links to work:** [FreeCodeCamp Challenge](https://github.com/Ellestial/100-days-of-code/blob/master/code-examples/030freeCodeCamp.js)


## Day 31: Febraury 7, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Struggled through another FreeCodeCamp challenge and could not get it. Continued going through some iteration array methods like forEach() and keys().

**Thoughts**: Most frustrating day of JS I've had so far.

**Links to work:** None.


## Day 32: February 8, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Researched best-use cases for map() vs forEach(). Also read more about reduce() and map() and took care of a few old FreeCodeCamp lessons on these topics with ease.

**Thoughts**: Today went better than yesterday. I learned forEach() is best used for when passing data through and not manipulating it at all. map() is best used for manipulating data and chaining functions. Map also returns in a new array, while forEach() manipulates the original array. Will get through the rest of the array methods tomorrow and then can review them overall more. This is slow-moving, but I'm definitely learning a lot about what is possible with arrays.

**Links to work:** None.


## Day 33: February 9, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished going through array methods on MDN. Also reviewed the distinction between map() and forEach() with my friend.

**Thoughts**: Today went much much better. In the end, the biggest (or only?) distinction between forEach() and map() is that map() returns a new array and uses the return keyword. It feels good getting through all the array methods, too. Going to review them tomorrow, and then jump into string methods.

**Links to work:** None.


## Day 34: February 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the array methods and started on learning string methods (which I think will go quicker than arrays did). Also tackled some algorithm challenges on Codebyte.com

**Thoughts**: I feel like I'm moving a lot slower than earlier weeks, but I know learning this information will be very necessary to me understanding how everything fits together. I think I need to actively have a few challenges to tackle daily to help flex my coding muscles in addition to me reading.

**Links to work:** None.


## Day 35: February 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Read through 5 string methods on MDN. Then tackled 3 intermediate algorithm challenges on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I got very frustrated when a filter() method wasn't working...until I realized I wasn't assigning it to a new variable. WHOOPS. I feel excited that I got 3 of the intermediate challenges done, though. This encourages me to read more about string methods, since one of the algorithm challenges was quick because I knew certain array methods would work best for the specific situation.

## Day 36: February 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learned all about regex! From remembering certain components with () to having optional portions with ? and counting 1 or more instances of an element with +, I learned the syntax.

**Thoughts**: I finally decided to face this beast head on, and it went super well! I used a really helpful tutorial that someone posted in a FreeCodeCamp Facebook group. I started going through some practice examples in the link, too, and will pick back up on that tomorrow. Here'x an example regex!
var testRegEx = /\d{3}\s\d{3}/;
var newArr = testRegEx.exec('555 555 3535'); // returns 555 555

**Links to work:** [Regex Tutorial](https://regexone.com)


## Day 37: February 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed all the array methods and continued learning and practicing regex.

**Thoughts**: Today went surprisingly well for a review day. I remembered most things about all the arrays, including being able to name all the mutator and accessor array methods off the top of my head. I took a Stack Overflow comment's suggestion with just going through Stack Overflow regex questions and answering them myself and seeing what the actual answers are to help me see best practices. Going well so far!

**Links to work:** None.


## Day 38: February 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed some regex and started a more complex algorithm challenge.

**Thoughts**: Not much done today unfortunately. I had a busy day and started at 10pm and was exhausted, so I had a hard time focusing. Tomorrow will be better.

**Links to work:** None.


## Day 39: February 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished a more complex algorithm challenge and learned a bit about APIs.

**Thoughts**: I felt pretty good about getting the algorithm challenge. Got to use my newfound regex knowledge! I want to go through the JSON APIs and Ajax section of FreeCodeCamp again tomorrow. It was only copy/pasting code in, so I want to make sure I understand how to pull in JSON data.

**Links to work:** [FreeCodeCamp Algorithm Challenge](https://github.com/Ellestial/100-days-of-code/blob/master/code-examples/039freeCodeCamp.js)


## Day 40: February 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed some API details from FreeCodeCamp and started on a random quote generator program.

**Thoughts**: Feeling pretty good! Starting this program was a bit slow-going. It's been a few weeks since I worked on any JS that wasn't explicit learning or algorithm challenges, so I have to get used to creating functions and calling them in events and whatnot. I started diving into the Twitter API and I'm already learning a lot. I need to stop the small learning steps via algorithm challenges and reading on MDN and just dive into projects!

**Links to work:** None (yet).


## Day 41: February 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on random quote generator.

**Thoughts**: Very frustrated.

**Links to work:** None.


## Day 42: February 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on random quote generator and got it so pressing a 'New Quote' button loads in a random quote, as well as that quote's author and source URL (if there is one).

**Thoughts**: Today went MUCH better than yesterday. I learned I needed to do an AJAX call in order for a new quote to load in, since a new HTTP request needs to be made to the API whenever I press the 'New Quote' button. Tomorrow I just want to take care of the final touches of figuring out how to have the Twitter API load in the new data-text of the quote/author for sharing.

**Links to work:** Tomorrow!


## Day 43: February 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Finished the random quote generator.

**Thoughts**: I spent 3 hours on this today instead of the minimum 1 hour. I also did a hacky-ish way of adjusting the Twitter share feature (creating a new button for each quote and removing the previous button), BUT IT WORKS.

**Links to work:** [Random Quote Generator](https://codepen.io/Ellestial/pen/ddJpML)


## Day 44: February 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started on a local weather app that tells you your location and the temperature/weather currently there.

**Thoughts**: This is going much smoother than the random quote generator already! Knowing a tad about APIs and AJAX helps a lot. Definitely still a challenge and I'm facing certain difficulties, but I'm excited.

**Links to work:** None today.


## Day 45: February 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I went to a "code with your peers" event at Jellyvision today! It was called Code & Coffee and was a meetup from the Girl Develop It group.

**Thoughts**: It went...OK. I'm way too shy to go to these sorts of things alone. I also didn't really get much of my own coding done at all because of people talking near me. I did explain Bootstrap to a few people, though!

**Links to work:** None.
