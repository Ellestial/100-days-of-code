# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Rewatched Objects section within The Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course.

**Thoughts**: I've been refamiliarizing myself with JavaScript on and off the last month, and want to make a more dedicated effort to spend 1 hour of learning/practice a day. Object refresher was helpful, but I also was able to make some connections to more advanced work I had learned last year from this refresher.


### Day 2: March 2, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Rewatched half of Intro to DOM section within The Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course and set up node modules/sass to watch for SCSS changes in Visual Studio Code.

**Thoughts**: Finally clicked for me how all of CSS is just defining new values for pre-determined object properties (color, line-height, etc etc) and that everything is really an object. Exciting to finally get that through my head -- I know that wasn't a revelation for me before when I began learning JavaScript.


### Day 3: March 3, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Rewatched remainder of Intro to DOM section within Udemy course and started Advanced DOM Manipulation. Also skimmed through the ABCs of programming reading.

**Readings**: "JavaScript & jQuery Interactive Front-End Web Development" - Jon Duckett. Chapter 1.

**Thoughts**: All this information so far feels very familiar to me. This is good, but also I don't want to spend too much time on too familiar of a review period.


### Day 4: March 4, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Watched one Advanced DOM Manipulation video in the Udemy course, started working on a counting game, and started reading Eloquent JavaScript.

**Readings**: "Eloquent JavaScript" - Marijn Haverbeke. Introduction.

**Thoughts**: I think this Eloquent JavaScript book will be very helpful. It's interesting even already to learn some more about computer programming, like how bits work.
