# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 1, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Rewatched Objects section within The Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course.

**Thoughts**: I've been refamiliarizing myself with JavaScript on and off the last month, and want to make a more dedicated effort to spend 1 hour of learning/practice a day. Object refresher was helpful, but I also was able to make some connections to more advanced work I had learned last year from this refresher.
